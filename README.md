# Practical Machine Learning Use Cases
This is a collection of some practical ML algorithm implementations:
1. Independent Component Analysis: breaking down multiple audio sources (people talking, sound of musical instrument, or some random noise) into each original audio profile.
2. k-Means Clustering for Image Compression: using pixel similarities to compress an image
3. Locally Weighted Linear Regression: what to do if the data has occasional peaks at some point?
4. Reinforcement Learning: using RL to balance a pole in a cart
5. Simple Neural Network: just a simple feed-forward NN application in MNIST dataset
6. Spam Data Classification: using SVM and Naive Bayes to classify spam
